        We saw the need in the healthcare industry to help patients and doctors with the

        administrative side of the specialist treatment process, so both could focus even better on

        their respective goals.
      </p>
        <p>
        Reality of modern healthcare system necessitates the proliferation of Patient Care

        Coordinators throughout the Nation. Patient Care Coordinators cannot be trained fast

        enough in colleges everywhere. However, unfortunately, only large medical facilities are in

        position to hire full-time coordinators, leaving the smaller practices at a measurable

        disadvantage, which results in lots of unneeded frustration and wasting of valuable time - for

        patients and care providers’ staffs alike. We provide this service to Patients and Primary

        Care Physicians completely free of charge, because we believe that this service is integral

        and fills the void inherent in the healthcare system.
        </p><p>
        Our background in operating clinics nationwide, dealing with specialists and insurance

        carriers for decades, gave us the knowledge required to successfully operate Patient Care

        Coordination in our practices. We have experienced the void in the industry first-hand, and

        have set out to rid our clinics of these shortcomings for the sake of healthier patients. Once

        we had accomplished that task, we started looking at how we could help other practitioners

        - and, more importantly, their patients - achieve the same. Soon enough, an idea was born:

        to create a company that will focus specifically on patient care coordination.

      </p><p>We have a staff of trained healthcare professionals, who are dedicated to Patient Care

        Coordination - which we make available to patients, primary providers and specialists. We

        provide the highest quality of service to all three, while reducing stress for the patients and

        workloads for doctors and their staffs.

      </p><p>Completely secure. PCS stringently adheres to HIPAA regulations regarding patient privacy.

        We do not directly handle or receive any of the confidential medical information - this

        information remains secure with the Specialist and Primary Care Physician’s offices. We

        facilitate the reporting between the two, but we only maintain the minimal data required to

        identify patients during the course of treatment.

      </p><p>We wanted this service to be COMPLETELY FREE for all patients. One of our central goals

        is not to add to the patient’s treatment costs. Primary Care Providers also receive our

        benefits completely free of charge. The Specialists that we work with pay us a monthly fee,

        which is low enough to be virtually inconsequential to their clinics, but is enough

        cumulatively to cover our internal costs. This ensures that we are able to maintain a

        professional staff, and hire the best individuals to better assist you with the administrative

        side of your specialist treatment.

      </p><p>While PCS has only been in business since the Spring of 2014, our management team has

        a cumulative healthcare experience of several decades. Our staff is selected based on their

        ability to successfully coordinate patient care cycles, leveraging their respective educations,

        professional experiences and personal traits.

      </p><p>As of right now, as far as we know, there is no direct alternative to our service. If there was,

        we probably wouldn’t be here. That said, we are experienced in exactly what we do, having

        healthcare and healthcare administration backgrounds, which gives us confidence that we

        will be able to provide the best possible quality of service.

      </p><p>Anyone, who finds themselves in position of having to visit a specialist can benefit from

        using PCS to streamline the process. Since our service is completely free of charge to the

        patients, there is no reason not to make use of it. Since most people, who require a

        specialist visit, would usually have much more important things to focus on, than the

        administrative “mumbo-jumbo” associated with the visit, PCS will provide the peace of mind

        and allow you to focus solely on your recovery. We know the process (we do this hundreds

        of times per day), whereas most patients experience this only several times in a lifetimes -

        at most!

      </p><p>You tell us which specialist you need to visit, narrow down the location and appointment

        times that work for you - we will offer you a choice of reliable specialists. When you will

        have chosen your specialist, we will assist with making and confirming your appointment

        and will obtain a pre-authorization for your visit from your insurance. We will keep track of

        your appointment and make sure to follow up with the specialist after your visit, ensuring

        that any applicable results are promptly forwarded to your primary doctor. All the while, you

        will not be required to do much beyond just focusing on getting better. We will ensure the

        smooth patient care cycle between your primary care provider and the specialist you

        choose.

      </p><p>The best way to start the process is to fill out the <a href="#">patient questionnaire here </a>. One

        of our friendly staff will be in touch with you promptly. You may also call us at [888-888-

        8888].

      </p><p><a href="contact.html">Email or call us</a> with any questions of comments. Our staff and management

        are dedicated to delivering the best possible experience to every single patient, doctor and

        staff member, who chooses to work with us.

      </p><p>

        <p style="padding-right:20px"><i>“A landmark report by the Institute of Medicine in 1999 cited the fragmented health-care

        system and patients’ reliance on multiple providers as a leading cause of medical

        mistakes... there have been improvements since, but “we have not done enough.

        Subsequent studies suggest the toll may be even higher than the Institute of Medicine

        estimated. A 2010 federal report projected that 15,000 Medicare patients every month

        suffered such serious harm in the hospital that it contributed to their deaths.”<i></p>
